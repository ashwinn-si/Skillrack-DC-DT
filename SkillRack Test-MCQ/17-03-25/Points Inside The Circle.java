/*
There are N circles whose center is on the x-axis. The N x-axis points locations are provided as the input.
The radius of the N circles are also provided as the input. The program must print the number of distinct
integer pair (xi,yi) points that are inside or on the circumference of any of these N circles. The sum of the
radii of all the circles will not exceed M.

Input:
2 3
0 0
1 2

Output:
13

Explanation:
The points inside or on the circumference of the circles are (0,0) (1,1) (1,-1) (-1,1) (-1,-1) (1,0) (0,1) (-1,0)
(0,-1) (2,0) (0,2) (-2,0) (0,-2)
