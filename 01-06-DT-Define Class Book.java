/*
There are N persons read a book. The total number
of pages in the book is X. For each person, the
program must accept the two integers
representing the page numbers(from, to) the
person reads. The values of N and X are also
passed as the input. The program must print the
most often read pages in the book in ascending
order as the output.
Your task is to define the class Book so that the

Input:
4 100
10 20
45 60
5 50
15 25

Output:
Most often read pages: 15 16 17 18 19 20
