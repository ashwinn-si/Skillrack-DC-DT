'''
The program must accept N nonzero digits as the input. For each digit D among the given digits, the
program must form a matrix of size D*D containing only D. Then the program must print the N matrices
horizontally in the order of their occurrence as the output. The empty spaces must be printed as asterisks.

Input:
5
2 3 1 4 2

Output:
2 2 3 3 3 1 4 4 4 4 2 2
2 2 3 3 3 * 4 4 4 4 2 2
* * 3 3 3 * 4 4 4 4 * *
* * * * * * 4 4 4 4 * *

Explanation:
Here N = 5 and the given 5 digits are 2 3 14 2.
So the 5 matrices are printed horizontally based on the given conditions.
2 2 3 3 3 1 4 4 4 4 2 2
2 2 3 3 3 * 4 4 4 4 2 2
* * 3 3 3 * 4 4 4 4 * *
* * * * * * 4 4 4 4 * *
